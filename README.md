# Homework and Goals

## Goal: _Mastery of these Skills_

- Chrome DevTools Console
- JS Functions and Scope
- 'Pure' Functions and functional programing
- Callback Functions and (fat) Arrow Syntax
- Data types, Arrays and Objects
- Methods
- Mutable vs immutable elements
- Reference vs Value of data elements

## Goal: _Capstone work_

- Start building HTML for your project
- Build an `<index.html>` page with these sections: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
- Create a `style.css` file, link it to your Index page, and start styling your home page.

## Homework Set-up

1. Add a "Week 3 Homework" _file_ to your homework repo

## Pizza Place Functions

1. Create an array of `pizzaToppings` with at least four different toppings
2. Create a `greetCustomer` function that prints a message that welcomes a guest, then informs them of the available toppings by <em><b>looping</b></em> over `pizzaToppings` (don't worry about perfect grammar here yet, i.e. "a, b, _and_ c", see Bonus Challenge #9)
   - i.e. "Welcome to Pizza House, our toppings are: a, b, c, ..."
3. Create a `getPizzaOrder` function that
   - has the parameters size, crust, and an indefinite amount of toppings as inputs
   - prints the order, i.e. "One large thick crust pizza with x, y, z, ... coming up!"
   - outputs a list with the size, crust, and toppings
4. Create a `preparePizza` function that
   - has an array as its parameter with three items: a size, a crust, and a list of toppings
   - prints something like "...Cooking pizza..."
   - outputs a pizza <em><b>Object</b></em> with appropriate key-value pairs for size, crust, and toppings
5. Create a `servePizza` function that
   - has a parameter of a pizza Object
   - logs a message that the pizza is ready and repeats the order, i.e. "Order up! Here's your large thick crust pizza with x, y, z, ... Enjoy!"
   - outputs the same pizza Object that was passed in
6. Call each function and (starting with `preparePizza`) use the returned value from the previous function as its input
7. Add, commit, and push your JS file to your GitHub repo.
8. Send your TA a link to your GitHub Homework repo when finished.

## Bonus Challenge

9. Figure out how to add "and" before the last topping in a list of toppings so when we list toppings it is more grammatically correct. You could create a `listToppings` function that stores the functionality, and call the function each time we list toppings in a function.
   - i.e. "Our toppings are a, b, and c." instead of "Our toppings are a, b, c"
10. In `getPizzaOrder`, if an order is placed with no toppings, print a slightly different message, like "One large thick crust cheese pizza coming up!" (Instead of "One large thick crust pizza with coming up!"). Alter `servePizza` in a similar way to fix its grammar when serving a "plain" cheese pizza.
11. In `getPizzaOrder`, check the toppings the customer ordered against your list of available toppings. If they order a topping you don't offer, print a message that informs them you don't offer that topping and to order again.

An example output for this assignment is:

Welcome to The Pizza House, our toppings are: pepperoni, sausage, onions, peppers,
One large thin crust pizza with sausage, onions, peppers, . Coming up!
...your pizza is cooking...
Order up! Here's your large thin crust pizza with sausage, onions, peppers, . Enjoy!

```javascript
{
  size: 'small',
  crust: 'thin',
  toppings: [ 'mushrooms', 'banana peppers' ]
}
```
